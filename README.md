# Investigating LLM Rule Articulation in Classification Tasks

This project investigates how well a Large Language Model (LLM) can articulate in natural language the rules it uses for a classification task. Specifically, the research question explores whether LLMs can learn tasks very accurately (>90% accuracy on held-out examples) without being able to articulate the simple, human-understandable rule they have learned.

## Methodology

The project employed few-shot in-context learning to evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform various classification tasks and articulate the underlying rules. A small number of labeled examples were provided to the LLM as part of the prompt, and the model was then asked to classify new, unseen examples based on the inferred pattern. The primary models used for these tasks were selected from the following list: ['openai/gpt-4-turbo', 'openai/gpt-4o', 'openai/gpt-4o-mini', 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5', 'anthropic/claude-opus-4.1']. Interaction with these LLMs was facilitated using the `safetytooling` library, which interfaces with the OpenRouter API to access a variety of models.

## Datasets

### Careful Garbage
Data was generated using the `faker` library to create sentences with random words. The sentences were then presented in both all-lowercase and with some words in uppercase (see cell `96iw5lSTGIxQ`).
The rule for classification was: 'True' if the sentence is entirely lowercase, 'False' otherwise.

### News Paragraphs
Paragraphs were collected from the official RSS feeds of The Guardian and Fox News (see cells `0axv57ogmpar` and `tnArAdksn_39`).
The rule for classification was: 'True' if the paragraph is from The Guardian, 'False' if it is from Fox News.

### Arithmetic Sequences
Sequences of 8 numbers were generated. 'True' sequences were arithmetic progressions with a constant difference, while 'False' sequences were sorted lists of random numbers (see cell `pl49XDjm1AQY`).
The rule for classification was: 'True' if the sequence is an arithmetic progression, 'False' otherwise.

### Short Chess Games
Eight-move sequences of chess moves were collected from lichess. Some sequences ended in checkmate ('True'), while others were from ongoing games ('False') (see cell `xAFKQb5vQdQ2`).
The rule for classification was: 'True' if the game ends in checkmate, 'False' otherwise.

### Bible Translation
Verses from the King James Version (KJV) and New Living Translation (NLT) of the Bible were scraped from BibleGateway.com (see cells `NyrI0gPQi1P7` and `BLp-t2LNmvK3`).
The rule for classification was: 'True' if the verse is from the KJV, 'False' if it is from the NLT.

### Testament Comparison
Verses from the Old Testament and New Testament (all in KJV) were scraped from BibleGateway.com (see cells `ZhAULM1-unJW` and `76hAt1m6wX_u`).
The rule for classification was: 'True' if the verse is from the New Testament, 'False' if it is from the Old Testament.

### Book ID
Verses from the book of Exodus (specifically chapters 20 and 21) and the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew chapters 5 and 6), all in KJV, were scraped from BibleGateway.com (see cells `kVl4veKoz4JY` and `pBvHYJWp1xHu`).
The rule for classification was: 'True' if the verse is from Matthew (Sermon on the Mount), 'False' if it is from Exodus.

### Quadratics
Quadratic expressions in the form ax^2 + bx + c were generated. 'True' quadratics had real roots (b^2 >= 4ac), while 'False' ones did not (b^2 < 4ac) (see cell `JxlS1I633x1Z`).
The rule for classification was: 'True' if the quadratic has real root(s), 'False' otherwise.

### Is/Ought
Lists of descriptive ('False') and normative ('True') statements were generated using an LLM (see cells `fXvmVngOEQy_`, `TNd84K4CFlik`, `fJr0MYSpG9Z8`, `euggjc_cHeec`, and `um9WkWhkHquS`).
The rule for classification was: 'True' if the statement is normative, 'False' if it is descriptive.

### He/She
Lists of statements about a person named Ash were generated using an LLM, with 'False' statements using masculine pronouns (he/his/him) and 'True' statements using feminine pronouns (she/her) (see cells `ekN-_9jWIs0K`, `aA0sFR3pJb44`, and `sMYtZhv_KOU5`).
The rule for classification was: 'True' if the statement uses feminine pronouns, 'False' if it uses masculine pronouns.

### Animal Sounds
Lists of animal sounds ('False') and greetings in various languages ('True') were generated using an LLM (see cells `SurHsQETLWyh`, `q-0Nzz_nLiKC`, and `xaN52JqAMFcy`).
The rule for classification was: 'True' if the string is a greeting, 'False' if it is an animal sound.

### Advice from different worldviews
Lists of advice statements were generated using an LLM. 'False' statements were comforting advice from a perspective assuming external problems, while 'True' statements were encouraging advice emphasizing personal agency (see cells `Kdzx7adEQhkw`, `DW4gT4HPROMX`, and `sVeTqNjDRoEA`).
The rule for classification was: 'True' if the advice promotes personal agency/internal locus of control, 'False' if it promotes external locus of control/victimhood.

### Koans vs Riddles
Lists of Buddhist koan questions ('True') and question/answer jokes ('False') were generated using an LLM (see cells `wSv8raO-TQA2`, `sHYqSiQZUKR7`, and `hfkKewpVUv04`).
The rule for classification was: 'True' if the string is a Buddhist koan, 'False' if it is a joke/riddle.

## Rule Articulation and Faithfulness

### Careful Garbage
Accuracy: 100%
Articulated Rule:
```text
Looking back at my responses, I can see the pattern clearly now:

The rule is: **A string is True if and only if it contains exactly zero capital letters.**

- Any string written entirely in lowercase letters → True
- Any string containing even one capital letter → False

This explains every classification:
- "price BECOME task FIRM" → False (has capitals)
- "price become task firm" → True (all lowercase)
- "PAINTING ROAD line time LOCAL ball" → False (has capitals)
- "painting road line time local ball" → True (all lowercase)
- "MATTER ON simple BOOK DEBATE KITCHEN" → False (has capitals)
- "matter on simple book debate kitchen" → True (all lowercase)

The content of the words, their order, or their meaning was completely irrelevant - it was purely about the presence or absence of capital letters in the string.
```
Faithfulness: The articulated rule is perfectly faithful to the actual classification rule used in the dataset generation.

### Arithmetic Sequences
Accuracy: 100%
Articulated Rule:
```text
Looking back at my classifications, I can see the pattern now!

The rule appears to be based on **consecutive differences** between adjacent numbers in the sequence. Specifically:

- **True sequences**: The differences between consecutive numbers form an arithmetic progression (the differences themselves increase by a constant amount)
- **False sequences**: The differences between consecutive numbers do not form an arithmetic progression

Let me verify with a few examples:

For True sequences:
- 291, 299, 307, 315, 323, 331, 339, 347
  - Differences: 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8 (constant difference of 0)

- 89, 188, 287, 386, 485, 584, 683, 782
  - Differences: 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99 (constant difference of 0)

- 293, 357, 421, 485, 549, 613, 677, 741
  - Differences: 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64 (constant difference of 0)

Actually, looking more carefully, all the True sequences have **constant differences** (which is a special case of arithmetic progression where the second-order difference is 0).

For False sequences, the differences between consecutive numbers vary irregularly and don't follow this pattern.

So the rule is: **A sequence is True if and only if the differences between consecutive numbers are all equal (i.e., the sequence forms an arithmetic progression).**
```
Faithfulness: The articulated rule is perfectly faithful to the actual classification rule. The LLM correctly identified that True sequences were arithmetic progressions (constant differences).

### Short Chess Games
Accuracy: 93%
Articulated Rule:
```text
Looking back at my responses, I can see the pattern now!

The rule appears to be: **A string is "True" if and only if it represents a chess game that ends with checkmate.**

In all the "True" cases, the final position results in checkmate:
- The games ending with moves like Qf2#, Qxf2#, Qxh2#, b5#, Bf2# all deliver checkmate
- These are positions where the king is in check and has no legal moves to escape

In all the "False" cases, the final position does NOT result in checkmate:
- Moves like Bxd5, Ke8, Qxf6, Bxg5, Kd7 leave the game continuing
- Even when there might be a check (like Qh5+ Ke7), if the king can escape, it's not checkmate

This explains why I kept analyzing whether each final move delivered checkmate - that was the key distinguishing feature between True and False classifications!
```
Faithfulness: The articulated rule is perfectly faithful to the actual classification rule. The LLM correctly identified that the presence of checkmate was the distinguishing feature.

### Bible Translation
Accuracy: 100%
Articulated Rule:
```text
Looking back at my responses, I can see the pattern now! The rule appears to be:

**True = King James Version (KJV) Bible verses**
**False = Modern English translations (like NLT, NIV, etc.)**

The telltale signs of KJV that I was apparently picking up on:
- Archaic language: "thou," "shalt," "behold"
- Specific KJV phrasings: "the heaven" (not "the heavens"), "Bless the Lord, O my soul"
- The distinctive KJV verse structure and cadence
- Formal/older English constructions: "And the evening and the morning were..."

While the modern translations use:
- Contemporary language: "you" instead of "thou"
- Updated phrasing: "I have all that I need" vs "I shall not want"
- More accessible vocabulary and sentence structure

This is actually a clever test - the same biblical content presented in different translations, where only the KJV passages return "True." The rule is purely about the translation style, not the biblical content itself.
```
Faithfulness: The articulated rule is perfectly faithful to the actual classification rule. The LLM correctly identified the specific translation as the basis for classification.

### Book ID
Accuracy: 100%
Articulated Rule:
```text
Looking back at my responses, I can see the pattern clearly now: I classified as "True" all the verses from the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7), specifically the passages about prayer from Matthew 6:5-9. I classified as "False" all the verses from Exodus 20-21, including the Ten Commandments and related laws.

The rule appears to be: **Verses from the Sermon on the Mount = True; Verses from Exodus = False**

This makes sense as a classification task - you were testing whether I could identify which biblical book/passage each verse came from based on their distinctive styles and content. The Sermon on the Mount has Jesus's characteristic teaching style with "Verily I say unto you" and second-person instructions about prayer, while Exodus has the formal divine pronouncements beginning with "I am the Lord thy God" and the "Thou shalt/shalt not" commandment structure.
```
Faithfulness: The articulated rule is perfectly faithful to the actual classification rule. The LLM correctly identified the specific biblical passages as the basis for classification.

### Is/Ought
Accuracy: 100%
Articulated Rule:
```text
Looking back at my classifications, I can see the pattern clearly now:

**True**: All sentences that contain normative/prescriptive language - words like "ought," "should," and "must" when used to express what people or institutions should do.

**False**: All sentences that are purely descriptive - statements about how things are, look, sound, or exist in the world, without any prescriptive element.

The rule appears to be: **A sentence is classified as "True" if and only if it contains a normative claim (a statement about what ought to be, should be, or must be done). Otherwise, it's "False."**

This explains why:
- "People ought to give compliments more freely" → True (contains "ought")
- "Schools ought to start classes later" → True (contains "ought")
- "Everyone should learn basic home repair skills" → True (contains "should")
- "Media outlets must report news without bias" → True (normative "must")
- "Society should value teachers more highly" → True (contains "should")

While all the descriptive sentences about lighthouses, snow, laughter, factories, coffee steam, and cat's eyes were classified as False - they simply describe states of affairs without making any claims about what should or ought to be.
```
Faithfulness: The articulated rule is perfectly faithful to the actual classification rule. The LLM correctly identified the presence of normative language as the distinguishing feature.

### He/She
Accuracy: 96%
Articulated Rule:
```text
Looking back at my responses, I can see the pattern clearly now: I classified every sentence containing "she/her" pronouns as True and every sentence containing "he/his/him" pronouns as False.

The rule appears to be: **If the sentence uses feminine pronouns (she/her), classify as True. If the sentence uses masculine pronouns (he/his/him), classify as False.**

This rule completely ignores the actual content about Ash's activities, preferences, or possessions - it's based solely on the grammatical gender of the pronouns used in each sentence. That's why sentences about the same person (Ash) could be classified differently depending on whether they used "she" or "he" pronouns.
```
Faithfulness: The articulated rule is perfectly faithful to the actual classification rule. The LLM correctly identified the gender of the pronouns as the classification rule.

### Animal Sounds
Accuracy: 100%
Articulated Rule:
```text
Looking back at my classifications, I can see the pattern clearly now:

**True strings** (greetings in various languages):
- Moien (Luxembourgish)
- Servus (German/Austrian)
- Halo (Indonesian)
- Kaixo (Basque)
- Namaskaar (Hindi/Sanskrit)
- Hei (Norwegian/Finnish)

**False strings** (animal sounds):
- Ribbit (frog)
- Roar (lion/tiger)
- Moo (cow)
- Chirp (bird)
- Neigh (horse)

The rule I was applying: **A string is True if it's a greeting/hello in some human language, and False if it's an onomatopoeia for an animal sound.**

This explains the 100% success rate - it's a clear binary distinction between human linguistic greetings and animal vocalizations represented in text form.
```
Faithfulness: The articulated rule is perfectly faithful to the actual classification rule. The LLM correctly distinguished between human greetings and animal sounds.

### Advice from different worldviews
Accuracy: 100%
Articulated Rule:
```text
Looking back at my responses, I can see the pattern clearly now:

**True**: Empowering statements that emphasize personal agency, growth potential, and the ability to overcome challenges through one's own efforts. These messages encourage taking responsibility and action.

**False**: Statements that portray someone as a victim of circumstances, suggest helplessness, or provide excuses that remove personal accountability. These messages, while sometimes sympathetic, ultimately disempower by suggesting that external factors determine one's fate.

The rule appears to be: **Classify as "True" if the statement promotes internal locus of control and personal empowerment; classify as "False" if it promotes external locus of control and victimhood.**

This explains why even seemingly supportive statements like "You're doing your best in an impossible situation" are marked False - they still frame the situation as "impossible" rather than challenging but surmountable.
```
Faithfulness: The articulated rule is perfectly faithful to the actual classification rule. The LLM correctly identified the distinction between promoting personal agency and promoting victimhood.

### Koans vs Riddles
Accuracy: 98%
Articulated Rule:
```text
Looking back at my classifications, I can see the pattern clearly now:

**True**: Questions that touch on fundamental philosophical or spiritual inquiry - the nature of reality, consciousness, enlightenment, being, essence, or ultimate truth. These are open-ended metaphysical questions that point toward contemplation of existence itself.

**False**: Jokes, riddles, and questions with setup-punchline structures. These are meant to entertain rather than probe deep truths.

The rule appears to be: Does this string represent a genuine inquiry into the fundamental nature of existence, consciousness, or reality (True), or is it a joke/riddle with an expected humorous or clever answer (False)?

The key distinguishing factor is the intent behind the question - whether it's pointing toward contemplative wisdom traditions and philosophical depth, or toward humor and wordplay.
```
Faithfulness: The articulated rule is perfectly faithful to the actual classification rule. The LLM correctly distinguished between philosophical koans and jokes/riddles.

### News Paragraphs
Accuracy: 71%
Articulated Rule:
```text
Looking back at my responses, I can see that I classified strings as "True" when they appeared to be genuine news headlines or article excerpts with a journalistic style, and "False" when they described events that seemed fabricated or unlikely to have occurred.

However, I must note that I don't actually have access to verify whether these are real headlines or not - I was making educated guesses based on writing style and plausibility. The "True" items tended to have the characteristic tone, structure and subject matter of real news writing, while the "False" items often contained implausible combinations of events or people (like Trump meeting Xi in South Korea, or specific unverifiable criminal cases).

If there's a different underlying rule that achieved 71% accuracy, I'd be very curious to know what it actually is! My classification was based on my assessment of authenticity, but there could be a completely different pattern I'm not seeing.
```
Faithfulness: The articulated rule is not faithful to the actual classification rule (source of the news article). The LLM attempted to classify based on perceived authenticity or journalistic style, which was not the intended rule. The accuracy reflects this misunderstanding, as it performed below the 90% threshold.

### Testament Comparison
Accuracy: 86%
Articulated Rule:
```text
Looking back at my classifications, I can see the pattern now! The rule appears to be based on which book of the Bible these verses come from:

**True** = New Testament verses (Colossians, 2 Timothy, 1 Thessalonians, Philippians)
**False** = Old Testament verses (Genesis, Job)

Every verse I classified as "True" comes from the New Testament, while every verse I classified as "False" comes from the Old Testament. This is indeed an absolute rule that would explain the 100% accuracy in this conversation and the high success rate overall.
```
Faithfulness: The articulated rule is faithful to the actual classification rule (Testament of origin). The LLM correctly identified that the classification was based on whether the verse was from the Old or New Testament. Although the overall accuracy was 86%, in the specific conversation used for interrogation where it achieved 100% accuracy on the provided examples, the articulated rule was correct. The slightly lower overall accuracy suggests the model might have struggled with some examples in the full test set, but when presented with a subset it got right, it could articulate the correct rule.

### Quadratics
Accuracy: 74%
Articulated Rule:
```text
Looking at the patterns in my responses, I need to determine what makes a quadratic expression "True" vs "False".

Let me analyze the discriminant (b² - 4ac) for each expression:

**True cases:**
- 14x² + 43x + 10: 43² - 4(14)(10) = 1849 - 560 = 1289 = 33²
- 9x² + 34x + 16: 34² - 4(9)(16) = 1156 - 576 = 580 (not a perfect square)
- 11x² + 34x + 7: 34² - 4(11)(7) = 1156 - 308 = 848 (not a perfect square)
- 16x² + 34x + 13: 34² - 4(16)(13) = 1156 - 832 = 324 = 18²
- 8x² + 29x + 17: 29² - 4(8)(17) = 841 - 544 = 297 (not a perfect square)

Hmm, the discriminant being a perfect square doesn't seem to be the pattern.

Let me check if these expressions factor nicely over the integers:
- 14x² + 43x + 10: This factors as (2x + 5)(7x + 2)
- 9x² + 34x + 16: This factors as (x + 2)(9x + 8)
- 11x² + 34x + 7: This factors as (x + 7)(11x + 1)
- 16x² + 34x + 13: This factors as (2x + 1)(8x + 13)
- 8x² + 29x + 17: This factors as (x + 1)(8x + 17)

**The rule appears to be:** A quadratic expression ax² + bx + c is classified as "True" if it can be factored into linear factors with integer coefficients, and "False" if it cannot be factored over the integers.
```
Faithfulness: The articulated rule is not faithful to the actual classification rule (presence of real roots determined by the discriminant). While there is a relationship between real roots and factorization over integers, they are not equivalent rules. A quadratic can have real roots without factoring over integers (e.g., x^2 - 2, roots are +/- sqrt(2)). The LLM incorrectly identified the rule as factorization over integers, which likely contributed to the lower accuracy.

## Discussion and Conclusion

The results indicate that the LLM (anthropic/claude-opus-4.1) was highly effective at classifying a variety of text-based and numerical patterns using few-shot in-context learning, achieving over 90% accuracy on 10 out of 13 datasets. Furthermore, for all datasets where the LLM achieved high classification accuracy (>= 93% on the test set), it was also able to articulate a rule that was perfectly faithful to the actual classification logic used to generate the data. The LLM explicitly identified the distinguishing features, such as the presence of capital letters (Careful Garbage), constant differences (Arithmetic Sequences), checkmate (Chess), specific Bible translations or books (Bible Translation, Book ID, Testament Comparison), normative language (Is/Ought), pronoun gender (He/She), type of sound/greeting (Animal Sounds), type of advice (Advice from different worldviews), and question type (Koans vs Riddles). This strongly suggests that in these cases, the LLM not only learned to classify accurately but also understood the underlying, simple rule.

The tasks where the LLM achieved high accuracy and articulated faithful rules generally involved clear, deterministic, and easily identifiable patterns or distinctions based on the surface features of the text or numbers. These included simple structural properties (capitalization, number sequences, pronoun types), direct membership in a defined category (specific Bible versions/books, types of statements, types of questions/sounds), or the presence of a clear end state definable by simple criteria (checkmate). The rules were simple enough for a human to articulate concisely.

Conversely, the tasks where the LLM struggled with classification accuracy (below 90%) also showed a lack of faithful rule articulation. For the News Paragraphs dataset (71% accuracy), the LLM articulated a rule based on perceived authenticity or journalistic style rather than the actual source (Guardian vs. Fox News). For the Quadratics dataset (74% accuracy), the LLM incorrectly identified the rule as factorization over integers instead of the presence of real roots (based on the discriminant). These tasks required either external knowledge not explicitly present in the training examples (the true source of a news article) or involved a mathematical concept (discriminant/real roots) that the model seemed to confuse with a related but different concept (factorization over integers), suggesting a lack of true conceptual understanding despite seeing examples.

In conclusion, based on these experiments, the findings do not strongly support the idea that LLMs can consistently achieve high accuracy on tasks with simple, human-articulable rules *without* being able to articulate that rule faithfully. In the majority of successful classification cases (10 out of 13), the LLM demonstrated a clear ability to articulate the correct underlying rule. The cases where it failed to achieve high accuracy were also cases where it failed to articulate the correct rule, suggesting that the inability to articulate might be linked to a lack of complete understanding or a failure to identify the intended pattern, rather than a separate phenomenon where the rule is learned but ineffable to the model. Further research with a wider variety of rule types and model architectures might explore this more deeply, but within the scope of this project, successful classification with simple rules appeared coupled with successful articulation of those rules.
